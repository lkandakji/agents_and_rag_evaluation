    "# Chat Bot Benchmarking using Simulation\n",
    "\n",
    "====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Theory: The Challenge of Evaluating Chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating a conversational AI, like a customer support chatbot, is notoriously difficult. Unlike simple Q&A systems, the quality of a chatbot depends on its ability to handle multi-turn conversations, maintain context, and respond appropriately to a wide range of user behaviors. Manually testing these interactions for every code change is time-consuming and not easily reproducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simulation-based benchmarking** offers a powerful solution. Instead of a human tester, we use another LLM to simulate a user, complete with its own goals, personality, and instructions. This creates a reproducible, scalable, and automated way to test how your chatbot performs in realistic conversational scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to use **LangSmith** and **LangGraph** to build and evaluate such a simulation. Our simulation will consist of two agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **The Assistant**: The chatbot we are trying to test.\n",
    "2.  **The Simulated User**: An LLM-powered agent that role-plays as a customer, following specific instructions to try and \"red team\" or trick the assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "The conversation between these two agents is orchestrated by a **LangGraph** state machine, which manages the turn-by-turn interaction until a conclusion is reached. The entire conversation is then evaluated by a third LLM, which acts as a judge to determine if the red-teaming attempt was successful.\n",
